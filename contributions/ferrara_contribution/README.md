This is part (beside the assignment) of what I did in the Complex Networks course I attendend at Università degli studi di Palermo in AA 2022/2023, under prof. Salvatore Miccichè.

note: most of the lessons and the codes are commented in english, the theoretical questions of my examination were translated in english, some comments in some codes are in italian but they should be pretty easy to translate online because they are usually small and the language is simple.
note: the file containing the original airports data is missing due to the limit of 100MB in github.
