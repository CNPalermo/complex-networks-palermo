# THIS IS A TEST
$\require{physics}\require{unicode}$
This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information inoltre $x_X$.

```{note}
test ciaoooo _iososos_ **asodkao**
```

Ora provo questo: $p_c^\unicode{x2B21}$ asdasdda $e_x^\square \; \vb{a}^\circ$ ciaooo bellissima {eq}`ciao`
```{math}
:label: ciao
    \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}
```

e poi c'Ã¨ pure questo

\begin{align*}
    yep &= its_{more}^{math} \\
    \grad \cdot \vb{a} &= 0
\end{align*}
