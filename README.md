# Complex Networks Palermo

This repository is the official database for the [_Complex Networks (21958)_](https://www.unipa.it/persone/docenti/m/salvatore.micciche/?pagina=insegnamento&idInsegnamento=155641&idCattedra=149802) course by [**Salvatore Miccichè**](https://www.unipa.it/persone/docenti/m/salvatore.micciche/) in [Università degli Studi di Palermo](https://www.unipa.it/). This repository was made by [**Alessandro Romancino**](https://github.com/alex180500).

The code is uploaded in a book made with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) which is available at the following website: \

### Dependencies

If you only want to run the notebooks you just need these packages (versions are the only one tested):
- numpy **≥ 1.24** _(for numerical calculations)_
- python-igraph **≥ 0.10** _(for most of the graph functions)_
- matplotlib **≥ 3.6** _(for general plotting)_
- pycairo **≥ 1.23** _(for all the igraph plots)_
